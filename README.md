# Lecture notes for the Spring 2015 Data Eng course
## Lecture 1: Github!
-Every class we'll be taking notes on github. Remember to share with Ken!

-This is a semenar class. I'll give lots of presentations

-Big Data SW Engineering. Here we go...

When you think about big data: 

  social networks

  data analytics, sampling, stats
  
      Use stats to get meaningful numbers on attributes of what you are looking at. You no longer need to sample with big data; you usually have all of the data

  storage
  
      NoSQL - great for a more dynamic database (like where the schema changes). Not as good at arbitrary queries the DB isn't optimized for. Data modeling is wicked hard!
      
        graph, key-value, columer
        
  data collection and cleaning
  
  infoviz
  
*Moving on*

Data Lifecyle:

Form question -> curation* -> Get data (collection, generation, etc.) -> Cleaning -> Storage -> Process/ Analysis -> Query, visualizing, act -> Form question

*triage (prioritization of data sources to decide which give the most value), persistance
